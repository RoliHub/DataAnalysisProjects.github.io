										<h2><a href="#">Employee Attrition Analysis Using Tableau</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/employee-attrition.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As a data analyst at Innov8, one of my key responsibilities was to develop a dashboard to track essential attrition KPIs. The dashboard was designed to help the company develop effective strategies for employee retention and foster a more engaged and stable workforce.
										To create the dashboard, I analyzed the HR Attrition dataset to identify the factors contributing to attrition. I then identified and defined five key KPIs to track: overall attrition rate, attrition rate by department, average tenure, absenteeism rate and employee satisfaction rate.By providing real-time insights into employee retention rates and highlighting significant changes in KPIs, my dashboard helped the HR department to take proactive measures to retain employees. My work on the dashboard contributed to the development of effective workforce retention strategies, which helped reduce employee attrition rates and increase employee satisfaction levels.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Zenith Electronics Analysis Leveraging PostgreSQL<br /></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/jason-leung-yf9hEzG8EKI-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This section of my portfolio showcases my ability to design and implement a database management system for a business scenario. The task involved creating a database for Zenith Electronics, a leading retailer of televisions in Lagos, Nigeria. Their goal was to improve sales operations, customer service, and gain insights from their data.

										Database Design -
										I designed a relational database using PostgreSQL to store and manage Zenith's data. The database consists of four tables:
										
										sales: Stores information about each sale transaction, including customer ID, product ID, staff ID, sale date, and sale amount.
										customer: Stores customer details like name, email (unique identifier), phone number, and address.
										product: Stores product information such as brand name, model name, screen size, and price.
										staff: Stores staff details including name, email (unique identifier), and role (e.g., Salesperson, Manager).
										The tables are linked through foreign keys to ensure data integrity. For example, the sales table references the customer_id in the customer table and the product_id in the product table. The data from provided CSV files (sales.csv, customer.csv, product.csv, staff.csv)  was imported into the corresponding database tables using appropriate methods like pgAdmin import tool.</p>
